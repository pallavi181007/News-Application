# INTRODUCTION

This is an application created for logging in and signup up users. The landing page leads to the login page for current users to sign in and also leads to a sign up page for new members.

# Test Items
- Web application(UX) 
- API
- Database 

# Features to be Tested
- Registration of new users (sign up)
- Logging in current users
- Landing page for signing in
- Sign out the logged in user

# Approach
We have approached this sprint by first creating the UX for the web application and working on creating an API to connect with the Database. We have created various test cases for the same.

# Pass/Fail Criteria

### Landing Page
- When the user clicks on the Sign in button, navigate to the login page
### Log In page
